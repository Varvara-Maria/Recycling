        "explanation": "Paper cups are coated with plastic on the inside. This is the only way they can hold hot drinks without getting soaked. Paper cups consist of up to 7% plastic. Like chip bowls or ice cream sundaes, they belong in the yellow bin. Since they are difficult to recycle, the production of disposable coffee-to-go cups will be banned across the EU from July 2021."

However, green glass is relatively stable against off-colors: up to 15 percent of glass of a different color can be mixed into green used glass and still be recycled in the same color. Blue and red used glass therefore belongs in the green glass container"

If the nearby composting facilities are accessible to rodents (mice, rats) or birds (crows, storks), animal waste usually has to go into the residual waste. You can usually find information about the exact local regulations on the web portals of your municipality or city."

        "explanation": "Packaging made of different materials must, if possible, be dismantled into its individual parts. So: The aluminum lid of the yoghurt cup should be separated from the plastic cup before both go into the yellow bin. Otherwise the sorting system assigns the cup to the aluminum fraction. By the way, packaging doesn't have to be rinsed clean, but it should be free of any coarse food residue."

        "explanation": "Small appliances with a maximum length of 25 centimeters can be returned free of charge at any time in electronics stores with a sales area of 400m2 or more - regardless of whether you bought the device there or not. In the case of larger electrical appliances, stores have to take back the old device if you buy a new one. Online retailers are also obliged to comply with this return policy.

            "text": "In the trash."
          }
        },
        "explanation": "Only largely clean paper is allowed into the waste paper. Light stains of grease are still ok, but a pizza box that is heavily soiled with grease and food residue goes into the trash. If only the base is heavily soiled, it can be disposed of separately in the residual waste and the lid in waste paper. Be careful with cardboard that is coated with plastic on the inside: it belongs in the yellow bin (free of any coarse food residue)."

However, reusing does not necessarily mean upcycling – enhancing ('up') old items into new products – to reintroduce them into the economic cycle ('cycling'). Conscious resource management aims at controlled consumption: Do I need a new bike if I only use it occasionally to go to the city, or is a used one sufficient? Do I need to buy the seventh sweater if I already have six? Can I repair the wobbly chair before throwing it away?\n\nIn general, the longer an item stays in the circular economy (excluding deposit bottles or recycled products), the better its overall ecological balance, meaning its compatibility with the environment. Therefore, it is advisable to think carefully before the next purchase to determine if the investment is truly necessary. Well-maintained clothing and items no longer needed can be donated or sold, extending their lifespan.",
